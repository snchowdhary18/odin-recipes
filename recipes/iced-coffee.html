    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Iced coffee is a cold variant of coffee. The iced latte and iced mocha are
      examples. A method of preparing such drinks is to make a small quantity of
      strong, hot espresso, dissolving the required sweetener/flavorings in the
      hot liquid and then pouring this directly into a cup of ice cold milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pre-packaged iced coffee is available as a grocery item in several
      countries.
